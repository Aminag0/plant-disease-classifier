# Plant Disease Classifier using EfficientNetB0

This project is a deep learning solution to classify 15 types of plant diseases using leaf images from the PlantVillage dataset. The model is built using EfficientNetB0 and trained in multiple fine-tuning stages for high accuracy.

## 🚀 Features
- Transfer learning with EfficientNetB0
- 98%+ validation accuracy
- Visual evaluation with confusion matrix and sample predictions
- Interactive Gradio app for testing leaf images
- 15 plant disease classes covered

## 🧠 Model Training
- Stage 1: Train only the classifier head
- Stage 2: Fine-tune last 30 layers
- Stage 3: Fine-tune entire model

## 📊 Evaluation
- Test Accuracy: ~91.6%
- Confusion matrix and classification report included

## 🖼️ Sample Results
Images with predicted vs true labels available in notebook

## 🔗 Deployment
Run the included Gradio app to upload a leaf image and detect disease with confidence.

## 📁 Files Included
